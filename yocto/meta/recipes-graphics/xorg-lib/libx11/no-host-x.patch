Subject: [PATCH 1/2] makekeys: Detach ourselves from X headers entirely

Subsequent to a121b7b0c210efe10bf93453b29050282324c906 we are no longer
building makekeys with enough -I/foo/bar to find the X11 headers, so if
they're not in a system include path, things fail. Since this utility is
only needed at build time, there's no real reason to demand the X
headers be installed for both the build and target machines if cross-
compiling, we can just assume a vaguely ANSI environment instead.
